            <p>The 1993 AASHTO flexible pavement design procedure and the 2008 pavement design method using the Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG) have adopted the resilient modulus as a key parameter for characterizing subgrade soil behavior. In this study, Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) tests were performed on 12 asphalt pavement sections in South Carolina to estimate the resilient modulus (MR) of the subgrade soil using three back-calculation tools: BAKFAA, SCDOT Program, and AASHTOWare. Repeated load triaxial tests (AASHTO T-307-99) were performed on soil samples obtained from the pavement sections to obtain a direct measure of MR. The data obtained from these methods were used to study the feasibility of using the subgrade MR found from the FWD test to subdivide pavement sections (ranging in length from 2 to 40 km) into multiple, shorter pavement sections for use in the local calibration of the MEPDG.  j</p>
